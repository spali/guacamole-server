 * Attempts to open a new recording within the given path and having the given
 * name. If such a file already exists, sequential numeric suffixes (.1, .2,

 *
 * @param path
 *     The full path to the directory in which the data file should be created.
 *
 * @param name
 *     The name of the data file which should be crated within the given path.
 *
 * @param basename
 *     A buffer in which the path, a path separator, the filename, any
